# Project 3: Around The U.S.

## Description

Around the U.S is a project where I created an interactive page where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.

This project focuses on the use of Figma, how to optimize images, adding media queries and the practice on how to build a responsive design and handle overflowing text.
