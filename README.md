# Project 6: Around The U.S.

## Description

Around the U.S is a project where I created an interactive page where users can add and remove photos, like photos of other users, and make a few minor adjustments to their own profile.

This project focuses on the use of Figma, how to optimize images, adding media queries and the practice on how to build a responsive design and handle overflowing text. Transitions and visibility for any popups. Creation of a modal box and implementation of JS funtions and methods to add and remove classes. 

All forms used in this project are validated via JS and some improvements on the UX modals have been made. Users can close the modals but pressing the close button, the esc key on their keyboards, or by clicking on the overlay.

This project uses HTML, CSS and JS technologies.
